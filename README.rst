Embedly - jQuery - An oEmbed Library to Replace Links with Content
==================================================================
Embedly - jQuery is a jQuery Library for Embedly that will replace links with
content. It follows the oEmbed spec (`oembed.com <http://oembed.com>`_) for
content retrieval, while utilizing http://api.embed.ly as a single endpoint.

Documentation
-------------
The most up-to-date documentation for Embedly-jQuery can be found on the
`README <http://github.com/embedly/embedly-jquery/blob/master/README.rst>`_.
If you've discovered the recursive nature of that statement, we applaud you.

The Embedly API documentation is at 'embed.ly/docs <http://embed.ly/docs>'_. We
suggest reading:

* `oEmbed Documentation <http://embed.ly/docs/endpoints/1/oembed>`_
* `Query Arguments <http://embed.ly/docs/endpoints/arguments>`_

You can continue to read the most up-to-date documentation below.

Key
---
Embedly requires that you pass a key with every request. To signup for a key
please visit `embed.ly/signup <http://embed.ly/signup>`_. To avoid adding your
key to every ``$.embedly`` call you can add it to the ``defaults`` like so::

  $.embedly.defaults['key'] = 'Your Embedly Key';

  # Directly
  $.embedly('http://embed.ly', {}, function(data){alert(data.title)});

  # CSS Selector
  $('a').embedly();

Otherwise you must add it to every request like so::

  # Directly
  $.embedly('http://embed.ly', {key:'Your Embedly Key'}, function(oembed, dict){
     alert(oembed.title);
  });

  # CSS Selector
  $('a').embedly({key:'Your Embedly Key'});

For the rest of the documentation we will assume that you set up the defaults
or passing the ``key`` directly into the call.

Requirements
------------
Requires jQuery 1.3.1 or greater::

  <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

And Embedly-jQuery. You can either download the file `here
<https://raw.github.com/embedly/embedly-jquery/master/jquery.embedly.min.js>`
or use Embedly's CDN like so::

  <script type="text/javascript" src="http://scripts.embed.ly/jquery.embedly-2.1.7.js"></script>

Using Embedly-jQuery
--------------------
There are two ways to interact with this library. You can call Embedly directly or use CSS Selectors to replace links

Call Directly
"""""""""""""
Will Return a JSON object representing an oembed or null, and a dictionary
object representing the original URL and DOM node.
::

    #Alert the title of a video
    $.embedly('http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfamTmY5REw', {}, function(oembed, dict){
       alert(oembed.title);
    });

    # Call with maxWidth option set to 600px and maxHeight option set to 400px.
    $.embedly('http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfamTmY5REw',
             { maxWidth: 600,
              maxHeight: 400,
                success: function(oembed, dict){
                           alert(oembed.title);
                         });

    # Pass in an array of URLs to load simultaneously.
    $.embedly(['http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfamTmY5REw',
               'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOC_JjNFkVw',
               'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTl3U6aSd2w'],
              {maxWidth: 600,
                success: function(oembed, dict){
                           alert(oembed.title);
                         });

     # Include a jQuery set of DOM elements so it behaves more like the CSS
     # Selector form below this form returns the jQuery set, so you can chain
     # jQuery functions after it.
     $.embedly('http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfamTmY5REw',
               {maxWidth: 600,
                   elems: $('#element'),
                 success: function(oembed, dict){
                            alert(oembed.title);
                          });

CSS Selector
""""""""""""
Use a CSS selector to replace every valid link with an embed on the page.
::

    # Replace all valid links
    $('a').embedly();

    # Replace a subset of links
    $('a.oembed').embedly();

    # Replace with maxWidth option set to 600px and method option set
    # to 'after'
    $('a').embedly({maxWidth:600,'method':'after'});

    # Replace only Hulu links
    $('a').embedly({maxWidth:600,'URLRe': /http:\/\/(www\.hulu\.com\/watch.*)/i,'method':'after'});

    # Embedly now supports chaining, so you can modify your original jQuery set
    # after triggering Embedly
    $('a).embedly({maxWidth:450}).css('backgroundColor','#dadada');

Valid Options
-------------
``endpoint`` [`String:oembed`]
  A string value that maps to one of three Embedly endpoints. A `paid plan
  <http://embed.ly/pricing>`_ is required for Preview and Objectify.

  * `oembed <http://embed.ly/docs/endpoints/1/oembed>`_ - a standard in 3rd
    party embedding, contains a finite set of attributes.
  * `preview <http://embed.ly/docs/endpoints/1/preview>`_ - returns a larger
    set of attributes (multiple images, RSS content, and embeds in page) for
    customizing your embeds.
  * `objectify <http://embed.ly/docs/endpoints/2/objectify>`_ - returns all of
    the meta and API data Embedly has for a link. Advanced users.

  Developers intending to use Preview or Objectify will have to include their
  own ``success`` callback function for handling the embeds. Our default
  success callback is designed to work with ``oembed`` only.

``key`` [`string:''`]
  You can `sign up <http://embed.ly/signup>`_ or `log in
  <http://app.embed.ly/login>`_ as an existing user to retrieve your Embedly
  key. A key will allow higher usage levels and extra features, see `breakdown
  <http://embed.ly/pricing>`_.

``maxWidth`` [`Number:null`]
  A number representing the "max width" in pixels a piece of content can be
  displayed in your page.

``maxHeight`` [`Number:null`]
  A number representing the "max height" in pixels a piece of content can be
  displayed in your page.

``URLRe`` [`RegEx:`]
  A regular expression representing what links to show content for. Use our
  `generator <http://embed.ly/tools/generator>`_ to generate a regular
  expression for a specific set of sources.

``method`` [`String:'replace'`]
  A string value to tell Embedly how to place the content in your page.

  * `replace` - replaces the link with the content
  * `after` - inserts the content after the link
  * `afterParent` - inserts the content after the parent element
  * `replaceParent` - replaces parent element with the embed content

``wrapElement`` [`String:'div'`]
  A string value representing the valid HTML element to wrap the content in.

``className`` [`String:'embed'`]
  A string value representing a CSS class you would like to assign to the
  wrapElement.

``addImageStyles`` [`Boolean:true`]
  A boolean value representing whether or not Embedly should use the style
  element to resize images based on the maxWidth and maxHeight parameters.

``success`` [`Function:default function`]
  If you would like to replace our default callback action, which takes
  ``['replace','after','afterParent']`` as a parameter and writes the
  oEmbed.code to your DOM element, you may do so with this function.

  Alternatively you can use the optional function parameter in the
  ``embedly({}, function(){})`` call, but we're deprecating that in favor of
  this optional parameter.  If you want to access the oEmbed data, but still
  keep the default callback function, we have introduced a new custom event
  handler that fires when the oEmbed object is returned. Read below for more
  information on that.

``error`` [`Function:default function`]
  Developers can write a function to handle URLs that Embedly does not. The
  error function has two parameters:

  * 'node' - this is a jQuery reference for the original <a> tag with the
     erroneous URL
  * 'dict' - an object containing error information. More information on what
    the dict includes can be found in our `Documentation
    <http://embed.ly/docs/endpoints/1/oembed#error-codes>`_.

``wmode`` [`String:'opaque'`]
  A string value either `window`, `opaque` or `transparent` representing the
  flash WMODE parameter which allows layering of Flash content with DHTML
  layers.

  * `window` - movie plays in its own rectangular window on a web page.
  * `opaque` - the movie hides everything on the page behind it.
  * `transparent` - the background of the HTML page shows through all
    transparent portions of the movie, this may slow animation performance.

``chars``
  Embedly will truncate the description to the number of characters you specify
  adding ... at the end when needed.

``words``
  Embedly will truncate the description while trying to split the it at the
  closest sentence to that word count.

``secure`` [`Boolean:false`]
  Set to true if you want your requests to be made to the HTTPS endpoint.

``autoplay`` [`Boolean:false`]
  Set to true if you want videos to autoplay when loaded

Custom Event
============
Starting in revision 2.0.0 we have started writing the oEmbed data to the DOM
elements using jQuery.data(). You can read more about the data function `here
<http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/>`_, but basically saves the oEmbed data on
the element for retrieval later.  For example::

  # $('a').embedly()
  # ... after the AJAX returns an oembed ...
  $('a').data('oembed')

This call returns the ``oembed`` object for each a tag, so you can access the
data later on. Because this data is not written to the DOM until the AJAX
requests are complete we have added a custom event listener called
``embedly-oembed.`` This event fires for each node when the oEmbed object is
written to the node using jQuery.data(). We did this so that developers could
continue to use our default callback function for writing embeds to the page
and still have access to the ``oembed`` data for customization.
::

  # version 1
  $('a').embedly({maxWidth:500}).bind('embedly-oembed', function(e){
    var oembed = $(this).data('oembed');
    alert(oembed.title);
  });

  # version 2
  $('a').embedly({maxWidth:500}).bind('embedly-oembed', function(e, oembed){
    alert(oembed.title);
  });

The event handler gets the oembed object passed in as a parameter as well if
you don't want to use jQuery.data(); The two are equivalent.
